  a: At this time, we are not planning on requiring masks or vaccinations for our guests. Depending on how the pandemic recovery progresses, we may have to limit in-person attendance or require the unvaccinated or all guests to wear masks if the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District requires such at the time of the wedding. We encourage guests to stay safe and do their parts to hasten the end of this pandemic. In any event, guests will be free to wear masks as desired. We will update this site with more information as the day draws closer.
